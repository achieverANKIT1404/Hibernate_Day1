# Hibernate_Day1
Hibernate is an open-source, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that facilitates mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language, such as Java. The Hibernate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are used to perform basic database operations on objects in the database.
