# Hibernate CRUD in Core Java
Hibernate is an open-source, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that facilitates mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language, such as Java. The Hibernate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are used to perform basic database operations on objects in the database.</br>
In Hibernate, the process of CRUD operations starts with creating a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class that represents a table in the database. The POJO class should contain private variables that represent the columns in the table, along with getter and setter methods.

To perform CRUD operations, Hibernate provides a set of interfaces and classes, such as SessionFactory, Session, Transaction, and Query. These interfaces and classes are used to create and manage database connections, create and manipulate objects in the database, and execute queries against the database.
